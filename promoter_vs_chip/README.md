# promoter_vs_chip

* In this folder, I think we will be looking at Chip-seq binding data, to see where MITF actually binds
* We may be looking at which transcripts have unique or shared promoters
* We could check whether MITF regulates specific transcripts through alternative promoters specific to transcripts
* In figures 1 and 2?
