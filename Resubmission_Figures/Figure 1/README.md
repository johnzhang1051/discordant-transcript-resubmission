### A:

1. Transcript/MITF Correlation vs. Parent Gene/MITF Correlation
* Average of Pearson and Spearman correlation between each transcript (Y-axis) and its parent gene (X-axis) and MITF. 
* Highlighted in pink are transcripts whose expression is correlated with MITF (Pearson correlation or Spearman correlation> 0.5)
* Highlighted in red are transcripts with discordant MITF correlation
