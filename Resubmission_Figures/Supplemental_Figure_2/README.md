# Supplemental Figure 2

A)
`Figure1_CCLE_TCGA_gene_trancript_mean expression.R` the `Density Plot of SKCM Ranks Across Transcripts` is the CCLE gene graph

`Resubmission_Figures/Supplemental_Figure_2/CCLE_ranked expression.R`

* This may not be worth doing, I attempted to create them on 9/10 with new data, but looked wonky.
* I think I may need to get new CCLE expression data for our new transcripts, but I might be wrong
* Since we have Tsoi data now, I could also just filter out Tsoi data


B)
Expression by Tumor Type (CCLE) ABR Total Gene
`ABR Expression Across Tumor Types` in `Figure_1_codes.R`


ABR Transcript specific (ABR ENST00000544583)
`ABR Expression Across Tumor Types` Line 197 in `Figure_1_codes.R`


* Note that we're going to remake this for two new examples:
   * PEX10 ENST00000508384
   * METTL9 ENST00000562961
