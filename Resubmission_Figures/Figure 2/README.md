# Figure 2:
* I've updated the data in the .R scripts in this folder
* The charts are based on the following:

## Number of EBox within 1kB of TSS:
Based on code in `New_analysis/Figure1_Ebox_MITFpeak statistic.R`
Graphs generated in `Resubmission_Figures/Figure 2/ebox_analysis.R`

## number of MITF ChIP peak within 1kB of TSS 
Based on code in `ChIP/Venn_promoter_peaks_shared.R`
Graphs generated in `Resubmission_Figures/Figure 2/Figure 2 Resubmission.R`

## Boxplot - MITF knockdown effect on transcript expression in each transcript group (all datasets):
Based on code in `siMITF/siMITF_no_filtering.R`
Graphs generated in `Resubmission_Figures/Figure 2/Figure 2 Resubmission.R`

## Barplot - MITF knockdown effect on transcript expression in each transcript group (all datasets):
Based on code in `siMITF/siMITF_no_filtering.R`
Graphs generated in `Resubmission_Figures/Figure 2/Figure 2 Resubmission.R`

## Proportion of transcripts in each group that are associated with a unique promoter:
Based on code in `ChIP/Venn_promoter_peaks_shared.R`
Graphs generated in `Resubmission_Figures/Figure 2/Figure 2 Resubmission.R`

# Significance:
* I based my significance (p-values) off the analysis done here:
* `New_analysis/Figure1_Ebox_MITFpeak statistic.R`
* I applied the same approach, and used the **raw** p-values (not the FDR adjusted ones I included in the code)
