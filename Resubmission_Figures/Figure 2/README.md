# Figure 2:
* I've updated the data in the .R scripts in this folder
* The charts are based on the following:

## Number of EBox within 1kB of TSS:
`New_analysis/Figure1_Ebox_MITFpeak statistic.R`

## number of MITF ChIP peak within 1kB of TSS 
`ChIP/Venn_promoter_peaks_shared.R`

## Boxplot - MITF knockdown effect on transcript expression in each transcript group (all datasets):
`siMITF/siMITF_no_filtering.R`

## Barplot - MITF knockdown effect on transcript expression in each transcript group (all datasets):
`siMITF/siMITF_no_filtering.R`

## Proportion of transcripts in each group that are associated with a unique promoter:
`ChIP/Venn_promoter_peaks_shared.R`
