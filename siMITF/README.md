# siMITF

* In this folder we are performing MITF knockdown analysis
* Using 4 different datasets:
  * PRJEB30337
  * GSE163646
  * Henja
  * GSE283655

## This folder has the following steps:

1. In `siMITF_no_filtering.R`


## Notes:
* I'm not sure what the results in this folder are used for
* For example, `final_MITF_correlated.csv` is not used anywhere else I can find
* I'm guessing that `CCLE_Tsoi_discordant_protein_coding.csv` is the final result, and is used in:
  * `siMITF/siMITF_no_filtering.R`, but the file is renamed as `discordant.csv`
